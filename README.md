# Cognitive_Decline_Predictors_Project
**Project Overview**

This project is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program. I selected a research question focused on identifying factors related to cognitive decline in older adults and sourced publicly available data to explore this topic. Utilizing my skills in Python, Excel, and Tableau, along with my understanding of statistical methods, I conducted a thorough data analysis and presented the findings in a clear and insightful manner.

**Project Goal**

This project analyzes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to explore factors associated with cognitive decline and general health outcome in adults aged 50 and older. Focusing on lifestyle behaviors like physical inactivity and smoking, the goal is to identify actionable factors that could help prevent or slow the onset of cognitive decline symptoms and imporove general health in this population.

**Research Purpose**

This project supports public health professionals, policymakers, and researchers in understanding:
- How lifestyle behaviors contribute to health outcomes among older adults.
- Geographic “hotspots” where intervention efforts may be most needed.
- Trends indicating areas of progress and ongoing challenges.
- Opportunities for targeted health promotion and policy initiatives.

**Data Sources**

- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**  
    Data from 2015 to 2022, including self-reported health behaviors, chronic conditions, and demographic factors.

**Tools & Skills**

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Folium)
- **Software:** Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Tableau

**Techniques Used**

- Data wrangling and merging
- Creating new variables
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Data visualization
- Correlation and regression analysis
- Time series data preparation

**Key Insights**

- **Lifestyle factors in relation to oucomes:**
  - Lack of leisure-time physical activity
  - Smoking  
    These behaviors are strongly linked to poor health outcomes among among adults aged 50+, highlighting these as critical areas for intervention.
- **Trends Over Time:**
  - Nationwide smoking rates have decreased, indicating positive progress.
  - Physical inactivity rates have remained stagnant, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.
- **Geographic Hotspots:**  
    States with high smoking and physical inactivity rates include:  
    Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Tennessee.  
    These areas should be priority targets for public health initiatives.

**Recommendations**

- **Physical Activity Promotion:**
  - Develop community programs such as walking clubs and senior-friendly exercise classes.
  - Partner with local centers and faith groups for outreach and events.
  - Improve access to safe, age-friendly outdoor spaces.
- **Smoking Cessation:**
  - Expand access to free or low-cost cessation resources and counseling.
  - Integrate support into healthcare and community settings.
  - Launch targeted media campaigns highlighting cognitive health benefits of quitting.
- **Integrated Health Programs:**
  - Combine smoking cessation, physical activity, and mental health support in holistic interventions.
  - Use personalized coaching to encourage sustained lifestyle changes.
- **Policy & Environment:**
  - Support tobacco control policies.
  - Promote active living through community design and incentives.
- **Ongoing Evaluation:**
  - Track progress and adapt programs to ensure effectiveness and equity.
